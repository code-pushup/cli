## JSDoc Documentation Pattern

**Structure**: Add very short descriptive JSDoc blocks for functions with this format:

```javascript
/**
 * [What it does]. [Why it exists].
 */
```

**Structure Breakdown**:
1. **What it does** - Very short description of the function's behavior
2. **Why it exists** - Very short description of the purpose/benefit

**Examples**:
```javascript
/**
 * Compiles pattern into cached matcher function. Avoids recompilation overhead.
 */
export function compilePattern(pattern: string): PatternMatcher

/**
 * Collects and caches input paths from output. Prevents repeated path extraction.
 */
export function getInputPaths(output: UnifiedStatsOutput): string[]

/**
 * Evaluates paths against include/exclude patterns. Core filtering logic for all path types.
 * Enables selective filtering by allowing users to focus on specific files while excluding unwanted ones.
 */
export function evaluateMatchers(...)
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Brevity**: Keep descriptions very short
- **Clarity**: First sentence = what it does, second sentence = why it's needed
- **No fluff**: Avoid verbose explanations
- **Action-oriented**: Start with verbs (Compiles, Collects, Evaluates)
- **Value-focused**: The "why" explains the benefit (performance, reusability, etc.)
