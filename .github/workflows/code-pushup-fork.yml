name: Code PushUp (fork)

# separated from code-pushup.yml for security reasons
# => requires permissions to create PR comment
# => for PRs from forks, needs to run on `pull_request_target`, not `pull_request`
# => `pull_request_target` is a security risk when secrets are being used
# => secrets needed for code-pushup upload
# => code-pushup for forks runs in separate workflow with no secrets access
