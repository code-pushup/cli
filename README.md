## 🌟 Why Choose Code PushUp?

### 🔌 Code quality tools are like phone chargers. Everyone has a different plug.

- **Incomplete or missing tracking** due to a mix of portals and custom tools is costly and unreliable 💸
- **No Standards** in data and processes leads to flaky, unmaintained zombies 🧟
- **Results are spread** over multiple places and need manual steps 📂
