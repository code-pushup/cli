<h1 align="center">🔎🔬Code quality integrations for any tool📉🔍</h1>

### Code quality tools are like phone chargers. Everyone has a different plug.

- **Incomplete or missing tracking** due to a mix of portals and custom tools is costly and unreliable
- **No Standards** in data and processes leads to flaky, self-maintained zombies
- **Results are spread** over multiple places and need manual steps

## Standards for code quality that integrates any tool

### Automated CI Integration

- **Seamless integration** into any CI pipeline with full control.
- Our tool **works on all platforms** like GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket etc.
- Get updates [on every PR](./packages/cli/README.md#-ci-automation)!
