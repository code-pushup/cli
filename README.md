### Code quality tools are like phone chargers. Everyone has a different plug.

- **Incomplete or missing tracking** due to a mix of portals and custom tools is costly and unreliable
- **No Standards** in data and processes leads to flaky, unmaintained zombies
- **Results are spread** over multiple places and need manual steps

## Standards for code quality that integrates any tool

### Automated CI Integration

- **Seamless integration** into any CI pipeline with full control.
- Our tool **works on all platforms** like GitHub, Gitlab, etc.
- Even custom tooling can be created over the 📦 [@code-pushup/core](./packages/core#readme) package
- Get updates [on every PR](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/code-pushup)!

---

### Flexible config setup

- **[📦 CLI](./packages/cli#readme)** for **collecting** audit results and **uploading** report to portal.
- **[📦 Core Logic](./packages/core#readme)** to craft your **custom tooling**.
